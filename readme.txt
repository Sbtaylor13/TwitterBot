# Simple Twitter Bot - Dune Sentence Tweets

This is a simple Twitter bot that tweets a new sentence from "Dune" every 15 minutes.

## Usage Instructions

1. If you want to change the book you tweet, update `Dune.txt` to your desired book and change "Dune" in the code accordingly.

2. You'll need your own `keys_test.py` file. Mine is removed for obvious reasons. You can find more information on this at [developer.twitter.com](https://developer.twitter.com).

3. To adjust the tweet delay, change the `900` seconds to your preferred interval.

Feel free to customize and use this Twitter bot for your specific book and preferences.
